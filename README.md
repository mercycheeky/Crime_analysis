# Crime_analysis
## Introduction

Welcome to the Crime Data Analysis Project! This project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing crime-related information. We explore patterns, trends, and statistics to better understand the dynamics of crime in a specific region. By doing so, we hope to contribute to informed decision-making and raise awareness about the challenges related to crime in our community.
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle. The data was in CSV format and required preprocessing before analysis.
The file was too big to upload. 'crime.csv' is the name.
**Data Analysis Steps**
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3. Visualization of crime trends over time.
   **Code and Tools**
- Python programming language
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for code development.

  **Results and Insights**
  Inside the jupyter notebook, You will find questions about the data and their resulting findings under the code
  **Visualizations**
  The heatmaps are just perfect!! They answer everything you'd like to know.
  In conclusion, this analysis provides valuable insights into crime and it's occurence patterns. It underscores the importance of observing past trends in order to be on the safe side by predicting when crimes are at its peak and what kind of crimes are they.
  Enjoy!
